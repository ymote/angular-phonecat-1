Our app is slowly growing and becoming more complex. Before, the app provided our users with a single view (the list of all phones), 
and all of the template code was located in the ***index.html***. The next step in building the app is to add a view that will 
show detailed information about each of the devices in our list.

### Multiple Views

To add the detailed view, we could expand the ***index.html*** file to contain template code for both views, but that would get 
messy very quickly. Instead, we are going to turn the ***index.html*** template into what we call a "layout template". 

This is a template that is common for all views in our application. Other "partial templates" are then included into this 
layout template depending on the current "route" — the view that is currently displayed to the user.


### Routing

Application routes in Angular are declared via the **$routeProvider**, which is the provider of the **$route** service.
This service makes it easy to wire together controllers, view templates, and the current URL location in the browser. 

Using this feature, we can implement deep linking, which lets us utilize the browser's history (back and forward navigation) and bookmarks.


### A Note About DI, Injector and Providers

<a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di" target="_blank">dependency injection (DI)</a> is at the core of AngularJS, 
so it's important for you to understand a thing or two about how it works.

When the application bootstraps, Angular creates an injector that will be used to find and inject all of the services that 
are required by your app. The injector itself doesn't know anything about what `$http` or `$route` services do. 
In fact, the injector doesn't even know about the existence of these services unless it is configured with proper module definitions.

The injector only carries out the following steps :

  1. load the module definition(s) that you specify in your app
  2. register all Providers defined in these module definitions
  3. when asked to do so, inject a specified function and any necessary dependencies (services) that it lazily instantiates via their Providers.

Providers are objects that provide (create) instances of services and expose configuration APIs that can be used to control 
the creation and runtime behavior of a service. In case of the **$route** service, the **$routeProvider** exposes APIs that 
allow you to define routes for your application.
